To run the hotel management project coded in NetBeans, follow these structured steps:

### Prerequisites
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
2. **NetBeans IDE**: Download and install NetBeans IDE from the [NetBeans website](https://netbeans.apache.org/). Make sure to include the Java SE version during installation.
3. **MySQL Database**: Install MySQL server and set up a database for the hotel management system. You can download it from the [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
